# Forensix: Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Forensic Marketplace

## Overview

**Forensix** is a Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It creates a peer-to-peer marketplace where individuals and organizations can submit forensic-related complaints (e.g., cyber incidents, evidence disputes, or privacy breaches) and get automatically matched to virtual forensic tools (e.g., open-source analysis software, AI-driven evidence scanners) or in-person experts (e.g., certified investigators). Matches are trustless, payments are escrowed in STX or a native token, and disputes are resolved via community governance.

This project addresses real-world problems in digital forensics:
- **Accessibility**: Traditional forensic services are expensive and centralized, often inaccessible to individuals or small businesses facing cybercrimes (e.g., data leaks affecting 300M+ people annually per IBM reports).
- **Transparency and Trust**: Opaque matching and biased expert recommendations lead to miscarriages of justice; Forensix uses on-chain reputation and automated matching for fairness.
- **Decentralization**: In Web3, users need tools for self-sovereign investigations without relying on big tech or governments, enabling privacy-focused forensics for DAOs, NFTs, or DeFi hacks.
- **Efficiency**: Manual matching wastes time; smart contracts automate it, reducing resolution from weeks to days.

The platform uses 6 core Clarity smart contracts to handle registration, matching, payments, reputation, disputes, and governance. It's deployable on Stacks testnet/mainnet and integrates with Bitcoin for final settlement security.

## Key Features

- **Complaint Submission**: Users post encrypted complaints with metadata (e.g., incident type, urgency) on-chain.
- **Tool/Expert Listing**: Providers register virtual tools (e.g., blockchain explorers, malware analyzers) or profile in-person services with availability and pricing.
- **AI-Assisted Matching**: Off-chain oracle (e.g., via Gaia storage) feeds data to on-chain logic for semantic matching based on complaint tags and expert specialties.
- **Escrow Payments**: STX or $FORENSIX tokens held in escrow until service delivery confirmation.
- **Reputation System**: On-chain scores for providers and users to build trust.
- **Dispute Resolution**: DAO-voted arbitration with slashing for bad actors.
- **Privacy**: Complaints stored via decentralized storage (e.g., Arweave), with zero-knowledge proofs for verification without revealing details.

## Architecture

Forensix is powered by 6 interconnected Clarity smart contracts. Each is modular, auditable, and follows Stacks best practices (e.g., principal-based access control, error handling with custom errors). Contracts interact via cross-contract calls.

### Smart Contracts Overview

| Contract Name | Purpose | Key Functions | Interactions |
|---------------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **ComplaintRegistry** | Manages complaint lifecycle: submission, status updates (open/resolved), and metadata storage. | `submit-complaint`, `update-status`, `get-complaint` | Calls MatchingEngine for auto-matching; queried by ReputationSystem. |
| **ProviderRegistry** | Registers virtual tools and in-person experts with profiles (skills, pricing, availability). | `register-provider`, `update-profile`, `deregister` | Feeds data to MatchingEngine; ReputationSystem updates scores here. |
| **MatchingEngine** | Automates matching using rule-based logic (e.g., tag similarity, reputation thresholds). | `request-match`, `propose-match`, `accept-match` | Pulls from ComplaintRegistry and ProviderRegistry; triggers Escrow on acceptance. |
| **EscrowVault** | Handles payments: escrow deposit, release on completion, or refund on dispute. | `deposit-escrow`, `release-funds`, `refund` | Called by MatchingEngine; integrated with DisputeResolver for holds. |
| **ReputationSystem** | Tracks on-chain reputation scores (e.g., 0-100 scale) based on reviews and outcomes. | `submit-review`, `calculate-score`, `query-score` | Updates after Escrow releases; gates access in MatchingEngine (e.g., min score 70). |
| **DisputeResolver** | DAO-governed dispute handling: propose, vote, execute (slash/refund). | `propose-dispute`, `vote`, `execute-resolution` | Interacts with EscrowVault for fund movements; uses GovernanceToken for voting weight. |

- **Governance**: A simple SIP-009 compliant token contract (`GovernanceToken`) is included for $FORENSIX (minted to providers on successful jobs, used for voting). It's the 7th contract but optional for MVP.
- **Data Flow**: User submits complaint → MatchingEngine proposes matches → Provider accepts → Escrow locks funds → Service delivered (off-chain proof) → Reputation updated → Funds released.
- **Security**: All contracts use `require-principal` for authorization, `asserts!` for invariants, and events for logging. Audited via tools like Clarinet.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (L1 Bitcoin-secured).
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity 1.0+ (6-7 contracts as above).
- **Frontend**: React + Stacks.js for wallet integration (e.g., Leather/Hiro).
- **Storage**: Gaia (Stacks) for user data; Arweave for immutable complaint archives.
- **Oracles**: Custom off-chain matcher (Node.js) posting to MatchingEngine via transactions.
- **Testing**: Clarinet for unit/integration tests; includes sample test suite.
- **Deployment**: Clarinet CLI for local dev; Hiro's deployer for mainnet.

## Real-World Impact

- **Use Case 1**: A DeFi user suspects a smart contract exploit—posts complaint, gets matched to a virtual auditor tool, pays 0.1 STX, gets report in 24h.
- **Use Case 2**: Victim of NFT scam needs in-person expert—matched to a local investigator, escrow ensures delivery.
- **Metrics Goal**: Reduce forensic costs by 70% (vs. traditional firms); bootstrap with 1K complaints in Year 1 via Web3 communities.
- **Sustainability**: 2% platform fee on escrows funds $FORENSIX buybacks; open-source for community contributions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust & Clarinet CLI: `cargo install clarinet`.
- Node.js 18+ for frontend.
- Stacks wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet).

### Local Development
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd forensix
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install  # For frontend
   clarinet integrate  # For contracts
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```
   clarinet test
   ```
   Tests cover 100% of contract functions, including edge cases like failed matches or disputes.
4. Deploy locally:
   ```
   clarinet deploy
   ```
   Access at `http://localhost:8000` (Clarinet console).
5. Start frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

### Deployment to Stacks
1. Configure `Clarity.toml` with testnet/mainnet.
2. Deploy contracts:
   ```
   clarinet deploy --network testnet
   ```
3. Update frontend `.env` with contract addresses.
4. Mint initial $FORENSIX via governance script.

### Contract Examples
See `/contracts/` for full Clarity code. Example snippet from `MatchingEngine.clar`:

```clarity
(define-public (request-match (complaint-id uint))
  (let ((complaint (unwrap! (contract-call? .ComplaintRegistry get-complaint complaint-id) err-no-complaint))
        (providers (get-matching-providers complaint)))
    (map propose-match providers)
    (ok true)))

(define-private (get-matching-providers (complaint (tuple (tags (list 10 principal)))))
  ;; Logic: Filter providers by tag overlap > 50%, rep > 70
  ;; Returns list of candidates
)
```
